# Project Milestone: Dictionaries

We have implemented initialization of dictionary and look-up feature in dictionary along with their respective typechecking. The test cases and code is written and a pull request has been raised.

## Target for March 11


By March 11, we aim to get all the examples mentioned in proposal working. We also added two additional examples which includes nested dictionaries. Overall, the examples we are targeting consist of following features:

- dictionary initialization using `dict` constructor
- built-in functions like `get`, `update`, `pop`, `clear`
- printing dictionary
- complex dictionaries and their respective operations. For example, nested dictionaries.

## Challenges faced in our week of implementation

We faced the following challenges during this week's implementation:
- For implementing dictionary, we had to implement hashtable and we wrote 100-150 lines of assembly code which was time-taking but it finally worked out!
- We had to keep track of our implementation with other teams: strings, lists, memory allocation and making sure it is compatible and modular enough so that it's easy to integrate.
