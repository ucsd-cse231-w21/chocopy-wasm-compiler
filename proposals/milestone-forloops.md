# For Loops Milestone

## 2 programs working as expected
   
program 1: basic `for` loop with `range()` 
```python
i:int = 0
for i in range(5):
  print(i)
```

program 2: `for` loop with `break` in `if` condition 

Note that this program is slightly different with the one in our original proposal. 

This is because we found that we cannot support lists without a proper list implementation.

We've decided to only support `for` loops with `range()` and adjust our programs accordingly.
```python
i:int = 0
for i in range(5):
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  else:
    pass
```

## test cases for newly added features:

1. iterate for 0 loops
```typescript
  assert(
    "for range(0)",
    `
    i:int = 0
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    i
    `,
    pyInt(-1)
  );
```

2. iterate for 10 loops

```typescript
  assert(
    "for range(10)",
    `
    i:int = -1
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
    i
    `,
    pyInt(9)
  );
```

3. break outside for-loop

```typescript
  assertTCFail(
    "break outside loop",
    `
    i:int = 0
    break
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    `,
    pyInt(9)
  );
```

4. break
```typescript
  assert(
    "break at 5",
    `
    i:int = -1
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
        if i == 5:
            break
        else:
            pass
    i
    `,
    pyInt(5)
  );
```

## Updates to the examples we plan for March 11
program 1 (complete):
```python
i:int = 0
for i in range(5):
  print(i)
```

program 2 (complete):
```python
i:int = 0
for i in range(5):
  if i == 3:
    break
    print(i)
  else:
    print(i)
```


program 3:
```python
i:int = 0
for i in range(0, 7, 2):
  print(i)
```

program 4:
```python
i:int = 0
for i in range(5):
  if x == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
```

program 5:
```python
x:int = 0
idx:int = 0
for idx, x in enumerate(5):
  print(idx)
  print(x)
```

program 6:
```python
i:int = 0
j:int = 0
k:int = 0
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
for j in range(6):
    print(j)
for j in range(7):
    print(k)
```

program 7:
```python
i:int = 0
for i in range(5):
  pass
```

program 8:
```python
class a(object):
  curr:int = 0
  def f(self:a):
    i:int = 0
    for i in range(3):
      self.curr = self.curr + 1

r:a = None
r = a()
print(r.curr)
r.f()
print(r.curr)
```

program 9:
```python
def f():
  i:int = 0
  for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
      return i
      print(i)
    else:
      print(i)
```

program 10:
```python
i:int = 0
j:int = 0
for i in range(5):
  for j in range(5):
    print(i, j)
```
## Biggest challenge

Till now one of our biggest challenge is overloading and duplicate definition. In python3, users could call range() in multiple versions with either 1, 2 or 3 parameters, however in our compiler, we can only define one range() function, or there will be duplicate definition problems.

The second challenge is the break statement. When there are recursive blocks exists inside a for-loop, the wasm br instruction needs a $depth
parameter to determine which block to break through. Therefore, we have to add a depth recorder inside the type check environment to record
the current depth and give the value to all break statements.

Another challenge is incorporating the for loop into class methods. Since we are implementing the range() function as an object, we need to handle the class variables, and the heap index correctly
